#  New Tech Stack (Needs a Name)

?! Obsidian -> VitePress → GitHub → Vercel ?!

## A. Obsidian

Easy way to write markdown (MD) files that you can copy and it will copy the markdown not the render. Boom. 

## B. VitePress

Why not in Rock? Well, true, ROCK RX!  
This is a case study, not a mandate; I am sharing principles—just so happens to be through the vite.press lens. 

Championed by the great Evan You.
VitePress is a static site generator built on top of:

- **Vite** (for fast bundling)  
- **Vue** (for the UI layer)  

Designed primarily for writing documentation using Markdown with Vue-powered components.

## C. Github

Version control king
+Devs are already trained on it

## D. Vercel 

GitActions => CI/CD pipeline (Continuous integration - continuous deployment)
