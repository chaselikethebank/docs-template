## A. Obsidian

Easy way to write markdown (MD) files that you can copy and it will copy the markdown not the render. Boom. 

## B. VitePress

Why not in Rock? Well, true, ROCK RX!

VitePress is a static site generator built on top of:

- **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)** (for fast bundling)  
- **[Vue](https://vuejs.org/)** (for the UI layer)  

Designed primarily for writing documentation using Markdown with Vue-powered components.
