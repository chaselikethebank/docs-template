# Why Do We Need a Knowledge Base?

A knowledge base is basically a big pool for, 'what did we say that was again?'. Turns out, we need to write it down actually.

We each carry mental models of the work we do—that’s our *map*.  
We also have the *territory*—our codebase as it lives in production.  

Documentation works best when it bridges the two.  

:::info Good Documentation  
- More detail than a mental model  
- Less detail than production

Good documentation converges skills, crafts, process steps, individuals, teams, and versions that might otherwise remain siloed or unaware of each other.  

> Knowing the **why** makes everyone’s input more valuable through shared responsibility.

**Reality:**  
The person in the intake meeting is often not the person deploying the code.  

**Reconciliation comes through documentation.**

When a designer knows a user must see and act on in a specific way, they will be informed to make that element 'loud enough' and design accordingly.

Building a knowledge base costs time, but neglecting a knowledge base costs more.  
The present feels most valuable, yet the future—discounted by present bias—is more expensive when ignored.  
Turns out, investing now compounds into **high leverage created through time (LCTT)**.
